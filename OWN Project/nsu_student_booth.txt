PROJECT FOCUS:

The name of the project is "NSU STUDENT BOOTH". If we think about a North South University Bank, only for university students where students can keep their savings and hard
earned money just like anyother bank. They can operate their transaction from this particular booth just like any other bank. Students can choose their courses as they want to
for semesters and the booth automatically calculates their choosen credit and tuition fees. Students can pay their tuition fees according to their credit fees directly from their
NSU bank account. A NSU student also can pay their cluub fees from this booth. The booth also shows the current educational and personal status of a student with their details which are 
pre stored in the program. This type of physical booth can reduce the daily hassle of online portal.
